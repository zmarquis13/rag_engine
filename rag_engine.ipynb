       "\n",
       "1. **Set a Regular Sleep Schedule**: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock (circadian rhythm).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Create a Bedtime Routine**: Develop a relaxing pre-sleep routine that signals your body it's time to wind down. This could include activities such as reading, taking a warm bath, or practicing meditation.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Limit Screen Time**: Reduce exposure to screens (phones, computers, TVs) at least 30 minutes before bedtime, as the blue light emitted can interfere with melatonin production.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Make Your Sleep Environment Comfortable**: Ensure your bedroom is conducive to sleep—dark, cool, and quiet. Consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or white noise machines.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Watch Your Diet and Caffeine Intake**: Avoid large meals, caffeine, and alcohol close to bedtime, as these can disrupt sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Get Regular Exercise**: Engage in physical activity during the day to help you fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Seek Natural Light**: Spend time outdoors during the day to help regulate your sleep-wake cycle.\n",
       "\n",
       "By implementing these strategies into your daily routine, you can improve your chances of maintaining a consistent sleep schedule.\n",

It involves the use of random variables and probability spaces to understand the relationship between inputs and outputs. Specifically, it considers a real-valued random input vector $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ and a real-valued random output variable $Y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, with a joint distribution denoted as $Pr(X, Y)$.
