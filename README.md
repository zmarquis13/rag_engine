### RAG Engine

A program that easily and efficiently turns any pdf (or set of pdfs) into a chattable RAG and updates automatically with new PDFs

Potential use cases:
* chatting over pdf textbooks for courses
* confining retrieval to a small set of trusted sources
* finding specific quotes in a large body of text

Usage:
* clone the repo
* set OPENAI_API_KEY in a .env file in the root directory
* put any pdfs you want to chat over in a folder called new_pdfs
* type the command ```jupyter lab``` and run the only cell (```python rag_engine.py``` to come soon) 
* chat away!
